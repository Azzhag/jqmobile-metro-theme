# Welcome #

Project aim is to build Metro UI HTML5-based theme on top of jQuery Mobile to mimic Windows Phone 7 native look and feel.

# Components #

### Metro theme ##

Metro theme is presented by jquery.mobile.metro.theme.css file and related images folder.

    /themes/metro/

### Additional plugins ###

All additional theme plugins are located at /plugins folder

    /plugins/app-bar/ - Windows Phone alike ApplicationBar control

    /plugins/date-picker/ - Date and Time picker. Note: if runs under Cordova environment and there is Cordova DateTimePicker
    plugin then it uses native UI instead of html

    /plugins/progress-bar/ - implements porgress bar control

    /plugins/toggle-button/ - toggle button

** Each plugin folder contains sample page with usage example.

There is also special js code exporting theme switching functionality located at

    /themes/themeswitcher/jquery.mobile.themeswitcher.js

### Cordova ###

The theme provides additional level of functionality when viewing on the phone under Cordova framework. This is implemented
by the following cordova plugins.

backButtonHandler.js - hardware back button handling functionality

dateTimePicker.js - js bridge for Cordova native DateTimePicker

jquery.cordova.metro.themeswitcher.js - provides functionality to apply system colors (uses phoneTheme.js below)

phoneTheme.js - js bridge for Cordova system colors detection plugin

### Samples ###

Demo pages for the jquerymobile.com site reference (official demo for other developers).

    /samples/jqm-public-demo/index.html

Does not contain any html pages inside, it uses absolute reference to test pages (see next section) located remotly.

### Test pages ###
